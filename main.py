    #
    # Library
    # Book
    # Management
    # with MongoDB
    #     Objective: Create
    #     a
    #     Python
    #     program
    #     that
    #     connects
    #     to
    #     MongoDB, manages
    #     books in a
    #     library, and stores / retrieves
    #     book
    #     information.
    #
    # Create
    # a
    # Database:
    # Choose
    # a
    # name
    # for your library database, e.g., "library_db."
    # Use
    # the
    # connected
    # client
    # to
    # get or create
    # the
    # library
    # database.
    # Create
    # Collections:
    # Create
    # two
    # collections: "books" and "authors."
    # Each
    # collection
    # should
    # store
    # information
    # about
    # books and authors, respectively.
    # Step
    # 4: Insert
    # Books and Authors
    # Prepare
    # Data:
    # Define
    # Python
    # dictionaries
    # with data for books and authors.
    # Each
    # book
    # should
    # have
    # information
    # like
    # title, author, publication
    # year, etc.
    # Each
    # author
    # should
    # have
    # details
    # like
    # name, birthdate, nationality, etc.
    # Insert
    # Data:
    # Use
    # the
    # "books" and "authors"
    # collections
    # to
    # insert
    # the
    # prepared
    # data
    # into
    # MongoDB.
    # Establish
    # a
    # relationship
    # between
    # books and authors
    # by
    # referencing
    # author
    # IDs in the
    # books
    # collection.
    # Step
    # 5: Retrieve
    # Book
    # Information
    # Retrieve
    # All
    # Books:
    # Use
    # the
    # "books"
    # collection
    # to
    # retrieve
    # all
    # books
    # from the library.
    # Print
    # each
    # book
    # 's information, including the associated author details.
    # Retrieve
    # Books
    # by
    # Author:
    # Allow
    # the
    # user
    # to
    # input
    # an
    # author
    # 's name.
    # Use
    # the
    # "authors"
    # collection
    # to
    # find
    # the
    # author
    # ID.
    # Use
    # the
    # "books"
    # collection
    # to
    # retrieve and print
    # all
    # books
    # by
    # the
    # specified
    # author.
    # Step
    # 6: Close
    # the
    # MongoDB
    # Connection
    # Close
    # Connection:
    # Always
    # close
    # the
    # MongoDB
    # connection
    # using
    # the
    # close()
    # method
    # on
    # the
    # client
    # object.
